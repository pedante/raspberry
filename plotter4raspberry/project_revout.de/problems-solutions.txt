mena 17 has 4 cables therefore it's a bipolar stepper motor

arlington array?
i don't know yet if it's a must, but it is present in the diagram of the project. in some tutorials i found the uln2803 being use with a raspberry pi

You must use the ULN2803A the A variant is the one for 3.3v inputs , other variants are for higher input voltages on the control pins.
