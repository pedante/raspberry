This project is well documented. code is in c. It prints "Scalable Vector Graphics (*.svg)"
following the steps from the project, it is easy to compile.

Problem: the wiring is from an older version of raspberry pi. it has 26 pins

posible solutions:

1- change the gpio numbers in the code   - no
2- try to use the same pins as descrived in the project and hope that piece of code "wiring pi would make the magic" - no tested

other steps would be to try to reduce the code, or find something writed in c with just the basic to move a stepper motor

solution:
the problem was that wiring pi version did not reconigze the raspberry pi 4b. I found the solution here:

$ gpio -v
$ gpio readall
oops - unable to determine board type... model 14
